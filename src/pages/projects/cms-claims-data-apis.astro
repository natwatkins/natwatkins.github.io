        <li>Diataxis documentation framework</li>
        <li>AAARRRP framework for developer relations strategy</li>
        <li>Focus on standardized site components, templates, and design patterns</li>

      <p class="mt-4">We developed a content style guide for the Data Analytics and Strategy Group (DASG) at CMS to establish program-specific guidelines</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
        <li>Agile and iterative</li>
        <li>Pages with complex content or user needs were mocked up in Figma for quicker reviews, experimentation, and iteration.</li>
        <li>Pages with straightforward content, such as documentation pages, were built directly on Jekyll templates in the development environment.</li>
        <li>After all pages were built, we proceeded with final team review and approval</li>
